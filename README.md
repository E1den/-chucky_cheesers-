# chucky_cheesers
Project
=======

There was not a git repository yet, so I made one. I included some docker files for local testing if you need it.
This needs to be public so we can all work on it, if you randomly stumble upon this please ignore it.

Locations
---------

*   The server backend is in node/data
*   The static pages (html,css,js,etc.) should be in web/data

We just needed someplace to actually start collaborating
